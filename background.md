UNIX/Linux background
=====================

Brief history
-------------

1970's: [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) is an [operating
system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) developed at
Bell Labs.  It supports multiple users working on a single physical
machine via
[multi-tasking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_multitasking)
and other means of time-sharing.

1980's: Many commercial versions of UNIX are developed by hardware
vendors.  The [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) effort aims
to standardize some aspects of the OS.

1990's: Two major open-source UNIX "clones" emerge:
[BSD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution)
and the [Linux kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux).  Linux
combined with the works of the [GNU
project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Project) provides a usable
UNIX-like system.  Apple adopts a UNIX-like foundation for
[MacOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS).

By 2010 UNIX variants became the main OS running the cloud (web
applications, commercial database systems, social media, etc.)

What's in store for late 2010's and beyond?  [Virtual
machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating-system-level_virtualization),
container-based architectures, OS support for hardware innovation
(increasing number of cores, flash memory), ...  UNIX continues to be
highly adaptable OS framework

Main components/functionality of an operating system
-----------------------------------------------------

* File system

* Process management

* Networking

* Security/access management

* User interface, shells

* Utility programs

Some terminology
----------------

Terms related to terminals/text interfaces:

* "Text terminal" / "Character oriented terminal"

* [Command line interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface)

* [Text user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-based_user_interface)

* [Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing))

Terms related to computer networks:

* [Host](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host_(network))


Key UNIX principles
-------------------

[UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy)

* Everything is a file (hide the filesytem implementation)

* C is the central implementation language

* Each program should do one thing well

* Programs should work together, be composable

* Text streams are the universal interface

* "the power of a system comes more from the relationships among
  programs than from the programs themselves" (Rob Pike)

* The "style [of using UNIX is] based on the use of tools: using
  programs separately or in combination to get a job done, rather than
  doing it by hand, by monolithic self-sufficient subsystems, or by
  special-purpose, one-time programs." (Kernighan, Ritchie)
